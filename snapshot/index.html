			<p>This specification provides a draft version of an Audiobook specification for the web. It references the [[pub-manifest]] for its vocabulary. This document also contains references to [[lpf]] and [[sync-media-pub]].</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>This specification is a profile of the <dfn>Publication Manifest</dfn> specification. It will describe the requirements to create an Audiobook.</p>

			<p>An Audiobook is defined as a collection of audio resources grouped together by a reading order, metadata, and resources, all contained in a manifest. This Audiobook can live on the Open Web Platform, or as a packaged entity.</p>

			<p>This specification is intended to standardize the audiobooks distribution model on the web and between businesses. It should facilitate different user agent architectures for the consumption of Audiobooks. The primary goal is to bring clarity to a part of the publishing industry currently underserved by standards, while opening Audiobooks to the Open Web Platform and new user agents. This specification does not outline what file types or formats should be used by content creators, only a manifest format for delivering them.</p>

			<p>This specification does not define how user agents are expected to render Audiobooks. Details about the types of affordances that user agents can provide to enhance the reading experience for users are instead defined in [[PWP-UCR]].</p>

			<section id="audio-terminology">
				<h2>Terminology</h2>

				<p>Terms with meanings specific to the publishing industry are capitalized in this document (e.g., "Reading System"). A complete list of these <a data-cite="!pub-manifest/#terminology">terms and definitions</a> is provided in [[pub-manifest]].</p>

				<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section is linked to its definition.</p>

				<p>In addition, the following terminology is defined for use in this specification:</p>

				<dl class="termlist">
					<dt><dfn id="dfn-file-name" data-lt="File Names">Supplemental Content</dfn></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Supplemental content is any content relating to the audiobook content but not required for the full experience of the publication. Examples of supplemental content include photographs, charts, or data relating to topics mentioned in the audiobook.</p>
					</dd>
				</dl>
			</section>

		<section id="audio-specification">
			<h1>Specification</h1>

			<section id="audio-construction">
				<h2>Construction</h2>

				<section id="audio-bounds">
					<h3>Bounds</h3>
						<p>An Audiobook consists of a finite set of <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a> that represent its content. This extent is known as its bounds and is defined within its manifest &#8212; it is obtained from the union of resources listed in the <a href="#audio-readingorder">default reading order</a> and <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resource list</a>.</p>

						<p>To determine whether a resource is within the bounds of an Audiobook, user agents MUST compare the absolute URL of a resource to the absolute URLs of the resources obtained from the union. If the resource is identified in the enumeration, it is within the bounds of the Audiobook. All other resources are external to the Audiobook.</p>

						<p>Resources within the bounds of a Audiobook do not have to share the same domain.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="audio-pep">
					<h3>Primary Entry Page</h3>

					<p>The <dfn>primary entry page</dfn> represents the preferred starting <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resource</a> for an Audiobook and enables discovery of its manifest.</p>

					<p>The primary entry page is an HTML resource that typically introduces the audiobook and provides access to the content. It SHOULD contain the <a href="#audio-toc">table of contents</a> to facilitate user consumption. The <a href="/pub-manifest/#address">address</a> of the primary entry page is also the <a href="/pub-manifest/#canonical-identifier">canonical identifier</a> (i.e., it serves as its unique identifier) for the audiobook when present.</p>

					<p>It is not required that the primary entry page be included in the <a href="#audio-readingorder">default reading order</a>, as the Audiobooks profile requires that only audio resources be present. The primary entry page should instead, if present, be included as a <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resource</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="audio-toc">
					<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

					<p>The table of contents provides a hierarchical list of links that reflects the structural outline of the major sections of the Audiobook and any supplemental content it may contain.</p>

					<p>The table of contents is expressed via an [[html]]&#160;element (typically a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>) in one of the <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>. This element MUST be identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[html]] value "<code>doc-toc</code>"&#160;[[dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document — in <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document tree order</a>&#160;[[dom]] — with that <code>role</code> value.</p>

					<p>If the table of contents is not located in the <a href="#audio-pep">primary entry page</a>, the manifest SHOULD <a href="#table-of-contents">identify the resource</a> that contains the structure.</p>

					<p>When an Audiobook contains additional resources (i.e. supplemental content) a table of contents SHOULD be included, the table of contents SHOULD include a link to all <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>, and all links SHOULD refer to <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a> within <a href="#audio-bounds">publication bounds</a>.</p>

				<h2>Manifest</h2>

				<section id="audio-properties-intro" class="informative">
					<h3>Introduction</h3>

					<p>The Audiobook manifest is defined by a set of properties that describe the basic information a user agent requires to process and render an Audiobook. These properties are categorized in the Publication Manifest [[pub-manifest]]. Where these properties are extended from the Publication Manifest is specified in this section.</p>

				</section>

				<section id="audio-context" class=normative>
					<h3>Manifest Contexts</h3>

					<p>An Audiobook manifest MUST start by setting the JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]]. The context has the following two major components:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the [[schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
						<li>the publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context</code></li>
					</ul>

					<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
		{
			"@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],
			&#8230;
		}
					</pre>

				</section>

				<section id="audio-type">
					<h3>Publication Type</h3>

					<p>An audiobook's< manifest MUST define its <dfn>Publication Type</dfn> using the <code data-dfn-for="PublicationManifest"><dfn>type</dfn></code> term&#160;[[!pub-manifest]], [[!json-ld]]. The type MUST be <a href="https://schema.org/Audiobook"><code>Audiobook</code></a>&#160;[[schema.org]].</p>

					<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to Audiobook.">
	{

			<section id="audio-accessibility" class="informative">
				<h2>Accessibility</h2>

				<p>The history of the audiobook is rooted in the world of accessibility. To create a fully accessible audiobook, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sync-media-pub/packaging.html">Synchronized Media</a> note to create documents where text and audio can be completely synchronized.</p>

				<p>To create an accessible audiobook using Synchronized Media, you need to both reference the alternative file on the item in the <a href="#audio-readingorder">reading order</a>, as well as list the file in the <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, a content creator can provide the text equivalent as HTML [[html]] resources in the <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>.</p>
