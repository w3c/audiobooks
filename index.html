			<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p>An Audiobook is a collection of audio resources grouped together by a reading order, metadata, and
				resources, all contained in a manifest. This Audiobook can live on the Open Web Platform, or as a
				packaged entity.</p>

			<p>This specification is intended to standardize the audiobooks distribution model on the web and between
				businesses. It should facilitate different user agent architectures for the consumption of Audiobooks.
				The primary goal is to bring clarity to a part of the publishing industry currently underserved by
				standards, while opening Audiobooks to the Open Web Platform and new user agents. This specification
				does not outline what file types or formats should be used by content creators, only a manifest format
				for delivering them.</p>

			<p>This specification does not define how user agents are expected to render Audiobooks. Details about the
				types of affordances that user agents can provide to enhance the reading experience for users are
				instead defined in [[PWP-UCR]].</p>
		</section>
		<section id="audio-terminology">
			<h3>Terminology</h3>

			<p>Terms with meanings specific to the publishing industry are capitalized in this document (e.g., "Reading
				System"). A complete list of these <a data-cite="!pub-manifest/#terminology">terms and definitions</a>
				is provided in [[pub-manifest]].</p>

			<p>Only the first instance of a term in a section is linked to its definition.</p>

			<p>In addition, the following terminology is defined for use in this specification:</p>

			<dl class="termlist">
				<dt><dfn id="dfn-file-name" data-lt="File Names">Supplemental Content</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Supplemental content is any content relating to the audiobook content but not required for the
						full experience of the publication. Examples of supplemental content include photographs,
						charts, or data relating to topics mentioned in the audiobook.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</section>
		<section id="conformance"></section>
		<section id="audio-construction">
			<h2>Construction</h2>

			<section id="audio-pep">
				<h3>Primary Entry Page</h3>

				<p>The <dfn>primary entry page</dfn> represents the preferred starting <a href="#audio-resourcelist"
						>resource</a> for an Audiobook and enables discovery of its manifest.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page is an HTML resource that typically introduces the audiobook and provides
					access to the content. It SHOULD contain the <a href="#audio-toc">table of contents</a>.</p>

				<p>It is not required that the primary entry page be included in the <a href="#audio-readingorder"
						>default reading order</a>, as the Audiobooks profile requires that only audio resources be
					present. The primary entry page should instead, if present, be included as a <a
						href="#audio-resourcelist">resource</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="audio-toc">
				<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

				<p>The table of contents provides a hierarchical list of links that reflects the structural outline of
					the major sections of the Audiobook and any supplemental content it may contain.</p>

				<p>The table of contents is expressed via an [[html]] element (typically a nav element) in one of the
					resources. This element MUST be identified by the role attribute [[html]] value
						<code>"doc-toc"</code> [[dpub-aria-1.0]].</p>

				<p>If the table of contents is located in the <a href="#audio-pep">primary entry page</a>, the table of
					contents MUST be the first element in the document — in document tree order [[dom]] — with that role
					value. Otherwise, the manifest SHOULD identify the resource that contains the structure.</p>

				<p>If the table of contents is not located in the <a href="#audio-pep">primary entry page</a>, the
					manifest SHOULD identify the resource that contains the structure.</p>

				<p>When an Audiobook contains additional resources (i.e. supplemental content):</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>a table of contents SHOULD be included;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>the table of contents SHOULD include a link to any of the <a href="#audio-resourcelist"
								>resources</a>; and</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>and all links SHOULD refer to <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#publication-resources">publication
								resources</a>&#160;[[!pub-manifest]].</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="note">When including supplemental content, be aware that users might not have access to this
					content unless it is linked to from the table of contents. It is strongly advised to provide links
					to all content that is not in the default reading order.</p>

			<h2>Manifest</h2>

			<section id="audio-properties-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The Audiobook manifest is defined by a set of properties that describe the basic information a user

					Manifest is specified in this section.</p>

			<section id="audio-requirements">
				<h4>Requirements</h4>
				<p>The requirements for the expression of Audiobook properties and resource relations are defined as

			</section>

			<section id="audio-context" class="normative">
				<h3>Manifest Contexts</h3>

				<p>An Audiobook manifest has to start by setting the JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]]. The context has the
					following two major components:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the [[schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
					<li>the publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context</code></li>
				</ul>

				<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
		{
			"@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context"],
			&#8230;
		}
				</pre>

				<p>To add the global language and direction of the manifest metadata, <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#manifest-lang-dir">language and direction</a>
					declaration [[!pub-manifest]] can also be added to the context:</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Declaring French as the default language for the manifest">
						{
							"@context" : [
								"https://schema.org",
								"https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context",
								{"language":"fr"}
							]
							...
						}

			</section>

			<section id="audio-conformance">
				<h3>Publication Conformance</h3>

				<p>The conformance URL expressed in the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#profile-conformance"><code>conformsTo</code>
					term</a>&#160;[[!pub-manifest]] MUST be "<code>https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks</code>".</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to Audiobook.">
						{
								"@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context"],
								"conformsTo" : "https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/"
								&#8230;
						}
				</pre>

			</section>

			<section id="audio-type">
				<h3>Publication Type</h3>

				<p>The <dfn>Publication Type</dfn> is defined using the <code>type</code>
					term&#160;[[!pub-manifest]].</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to Audiobook.">{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/wp-context"],

    …
}</pre>

				<p>If a <code>type</code> is not specified, <a href="https://schema.org/Audiobook"
							><code>Audiobook</code></a>&#160;[[!schema.org]] is assumed as the default.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="audio-properties">
				<h3>Properties</h3>

				<section id="audio-creators">
					<h4>Creators</h4>

					<p>A <dfn>creator</dfn> is an individual or entity responsible for the creation of the Web
						Publication. The Audiobooks profile can use the full list of <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#creators">creators</a> specified in Web
						Publications.</p>

					<p>The creators list includes two recommended creators for Audiobooks:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://schema.org/author">author</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://schema.org/readBy">readBy</a></li>

				</section>

				<section id="audio-duration">
					<h4>Duration</h4>

					<p>A <dfn>duration</dfn> is the length of the audio resources in an Audiobook. The duration property
						is fully defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#duration">Publication
							Manifest</a> specification.</p>

					<p>Duration SHOULD be expressed for the entirety of the audiobook as part of the manifest, and
						SHOULD be present at the item level in the <a href="#audio-readingorder">default reading
							order</a>.</p>

					<p>When a content creator specifies both the duration for the audiobook and item-level duration in
						the <a href="#audio-readingorder">default reading order</a> the resource-level duration SHOULD
						be equal to the sum of the durations of the items in the reading order.</p>

					<pre class="example" title="Duration of an Audiobook in Seconds">

			<section id="audio-readingorder">
				<h3>Default Reading Order</h3>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#default-reading-order"><dfn>default reading
							order</dfn></a> is a specific progression through the audio resources in the audiobook.</p>

				<p>The default reading order MUST contain at least one audio resource, which MAY be identified by the
						<code>type</code> of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#value-linked-resource"
							><code>LinkedResource</code></a>. The default reading order MUST NOT contain non-audio
					resources.</p>

				<p>An audio resource can be referenced in its entirety via a URL [[url]], or for content where multiple
					chapters occupy a single file by using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/">media
						fragments</a> [[media-frags]] to locate the exact starting point.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Audiobook Reading Order for a Single Resource">

				<h3>Resource List</h3>

				<p>The <dfn>resource list</dfn> enumerates any additional resources used in the processing and rendering

			</section>

			<section id="audio-accessibility" class="informative">
				<h3>Accessibility</h3>

				<p>The history of the audiobook is rooted in the world of accessibility. To create a fully accessible
					audiobook, it is recommended to use <a
						href="https://w3c.github.io/sync-media-pub/synchronized-narration.html">Synchronized
						Narration</a> to create documents where text and audio can be completely synchronized.
					Additional details on incorporating Synchronized Narration files into a publication's fileset are
					given in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sync-media-pub/incorporating-synchronized-narration"
						>Incorporating Synchronized Narration into a Publication Manifest</a>.</p>

				<p>To create an accessible audiobook using Synchronized Narration, you need to both reference the
					alternative file on the item in the <a href="#audio-readingorder">reading order</a>, as well as list
					the file in the <a href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, a content creator can provide the text equivalent as HTML [[html]] resources in the <a
						href="#audio-resourcelist">resources</a>.</p>

				<p class="ednote">At the time of this publication, a <a
						href="https://w3c.github.io/sync-media-pub/synchronized-narration.html">Synchronized
						Narration</a> specification suitable for use in audiobooks is in development. It is believed
					this specification can already meet synchronization needs, though reliance on a developing
					specification clearly carries no guarantee of backward compatibility. Participation and comments
					from the digital publishing community, and especially from implementors are encouraged.</p>

			<p>This profile acknowledges the following considerations:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>References within the <a href="#audio-readingorder">Reading Order</a> and <a
						href="#audio-resourcelist">Resource List</a> can be references to both remote and local

		</section>
		<section id="audio-ua-behaviour" class="informative">
			<h2>User Agent Behaviors for Audiobooks</h2>

			<p>This section outlines the expected user agent behaviors for implementation of audiobooks. For processing
				instructions, user agents should refer to the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#manifest-processing"><code>Processing a
					Manifest</code></a> section of the Publication Manifest specification, and conform to any behavior
				described there.</p>

			<p>All user agent behaviors described in this section are intended to provide implementors with guidance,
				not strict requirements. Behaviors in this document are taken mainly from the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">Use Cases and Requirements</a> note published by the working
				group.</p>

			<section id="audio-ua-navigation">
				<h3>Opening and Navigating the Contents of an Audiobook</h3>

				<p>When a user agent opens an Audiobook, and the manifest processes according to the rules laid out in
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#manifest-processing">Publication Manifest</a>, it
					should be opened by the User Agent. The <a href="#audio-readingorder">Reading Order</a> or, if
					available, <a href="#audio-toc">Table of Contents</a> should be accessible to the user. A User Agent
					should be able to provide a list of the contents of the audiobook available to the user when
					requested. If a non-audio resource is present in the Reading Order, the User Agent can choose to
					present it to the user or skip it.</p>

				<p>User agents should provide a means of rendering non-audio resources within the Reading Order and
					Resource list. If the content cannot be rendered by the user agent, it is recommended that the user
					agent inform the user that the content is present but cannot be rendered.</p>

				<p>The <a href="#audio-pep">Primary Entry Page</a> is intended to be, when available, the entry point to
					the audiobook. If a content creator has provided a primary entry page, and the User Agent is capable
					of rendering or processing HTML content, it should be the first thing presented to the user. The
					Primary Entry Page may or may not contain a Table of Contents, if included using the
						<code>role="doc-toc"</code> it should be treated as the Table of Contents. If the Table of
					Contents is a separate document, it can be rendered however the User Agent chooses as long as it
					meets the requirements laid out above. If no Table of Contents is included in the Primary Entry Page
					or elsewhere, the User Agent should refer to the Reading Order.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="audio-ua-playback">
				<h3>Audiobook Playability</h3>

				<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">Use Cases and Requirements</a> note, an
					audiobook must be navigable in the User Agent. This means that a User Agent must provide methods for
					the user to move through the audiobook in a linear or non-linear fashion by either moving through
					the <a href="#audio-readingorder">Reading Order</a> seamlessly or by accessing the <a
						href="#audio-toc">Table of Contents</a>. The User Agent should also allow the user to move
					through individual audio files in short time increments.</p>

				<p>For an audiobook, the User Agent should provide a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/#player"
						>player interface</a> that will allow the user to navigate, play, or pause the audiobook. This
					interface can be represented to the user in any way (i.e. physical buttons, visual interface,
					keyboard input, or voice commands), but should be accessible at any point in the listening
					experience.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="audio-ua-packaging">
				<h3>Audiobook Packaging and Offlining</h3>

				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp-ucr/">Use Cases and Requirements</a> note recommends that
					content be available offline and that any packaged formats should not affect the iterations of the
					publications. This means that even if the content is copied many times to many users via multiple
					User Agents, the core manifest and it's identifier are never changed.</p>

				<p>This specification recommends the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/lpf">Lightweight Packaging
						Format</a> for packaging audiobook content, but this is not a requirement. Audiobook User Agents
					should be able to ingest LPF files for play, and should display content according to the
					requirements and recommendations in this document.</p>

				<p>If a User Agent is serving the content directly from their service (i.e. as a retailer or repository
					of content), it is recommended that they provide a method for offlining or downloading the content
					to the user. This can be in any format they choose, but the audiobook should be complete and valid
					and the contents listed in the manifest should be served in their entirety. Even if a User Agent
					does not support the display of a certain resource (i.e. an image file or data table), it should
					still be available to the user for download.</p>

				<p>This specification does not provide a method for content creators to protect or watermark their
					content, as there are existing methods available in the market today. User Agents who work with
					content creators that wish to protect or limit the distribution of their content can choose a method
					that works best for their requirements.</p>

			</section>

			<section id="audio-ua-accessibility">
				<h3>Audiobooks Accessibility</h3>

				<p>This specification recommends and provides a method for content creators to create fully <a
						href="#audio-accessibility">accessible audiobooks</a>. User Agents should use this information,
					in the section on Accessibility, to implement accessible audiobook interfaces. It is recommended
					that User Agents provide accessible player interfaces, as well as a method for content creators who
					have provided <code>alternate</code> content to have that content displayed.</p>
